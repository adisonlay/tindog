### Final group Project by Adison Lay and Heondo Kim

For our web development program we were placed into a group of two to make our first full stack application 
(without prior boilerplate or wireframes). First time using Node and hooks but a great learning experience.

#### Tools
* NodeJS
* MySQL 5.7
* React
* ReactStrap
* Google Maps API

##### Main Features
The main features of the project were to allow users to create profiles of their dog and themselves, create
open days/locations they want to meet, and join/reject those playdate openings.

It was a ton of fun trying so many new things in a time constraint but I think we pulled off something pretty
impressive for a first go.
